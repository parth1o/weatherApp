# weatherApp
A react, typescript web app utilizing the openweathermap API.

I have unhidden my API key to make it easier for the marker to run and mark my web app locally.
The web app is currently not functioning as expected in the azure production environment for some unknown reason but it works perfectly on a local environment.
I created this web app as it seemed simple and easy to develop right from the on set.
